So I switched to [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Oh, yeah, and I'm blogging again.

### Indulge Me While I Pretend You Care Why ###

My reasons for switching from [Mephisto](http://www.mephistoblog.com) are the same as most everyone else. I want my posts as text files, backed up, and not in a database. I toyed with rolling my own, but I've been too busy with clients to make the time for that, plus, when I saw Jekyll and looked at its codebase, I saw an opportunity to take a nice shortcut. Right now, the goal is just to have a place again where I can share. That's why I am shamelessly bogarting [Tom Preston-Werner's](http://tom.preston-werner.com) design. But hopefully, I'll slowly evolve it and make it more my own.

Thanks to Tom both for Jekyll and for allowing the use of his design.

## Agile in Your Own Skin ##

I've recently been thinking a lot about how important honesty is in an agile work environment. Sure, it's important in any environment, but I believe agile requires a level of and commitment to honesty that I haven't seen in more traditional company/software development environments. I think it's really part of the core essence of agile, one of the things that separates a team really doing and succeeding with agile from a team that just incorporates some agile practices like stand-ups and iterations.

I was planning to write a post about it, but then I saw a 60-minute video of Kent Beck talking about it. It blew me away, and Kent gives the topic a much better treatment than I could. Enjoy.

teaser: Seeing some sort of usability touch in Kubuntu made me giddy. Even if it'd probably been there for years.

I just upgraded from Kubuntu Feisty to Gutsy Gibbon. The upgrade via Adept didn't go so well, but the fresh install from a Live CD was painless. Still, Linux has come a long way from what I vaguely remember about Slackware 6 or 7 years ago.

I was in the directory for a small rails project I'm playing with, and without thinking, I typed

> svn st

The response I got was:

> The program 'svn' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing: sudo apt-get install subversion

This has probably been around for a long time and is not new to Gutsy, but it's the first time I've seen it. Either way, it's a nice usability touch. The developers recognized that when you type 'svn', you're looking for subversion, and they went the extra mile to point you in the right direction. Very cool.

Of course, it did happen in a terminal...this is Linux after all.

## About ##

I'm a freelance software developer splitting my time between Gainesville and St. Petersburg, FL.

I switched from .NET to Ruby on Rails in 2007 and haven't looked back. I'm also a huge proponent of agile development methodologies and practices (especially TDD/BDD), and I'm particularly interested in their application to distributed teams, probably because I've spent years working remotely. I choose these technologies and methodologies not because I think they are cool (although that's true), but because they are the most effective ways to work that I've found so far. One of my duties as a software developer is to continuously improve, and I enjoy working with others who strive to do the same.

When I'm not on a computer, chances are I'm practicing kung fu, playing jazz piano, enjoying a nice meal and/or traveling.
